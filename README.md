# QB-Squared
A question bank generator for Moodle XML and QTI XML (although more precisely for Canvas) from Google Sheets data that I've worked on while working at UCLA's Humanities Technology department. It's code is all in Google Apps Script. Here's a link to the Bitbucket repository:
https://bitbucket.org/uclacdh/qb-2-question-bank-quick-builder/src/master/

My primary contribution to this project was the implementation of a QTI export from Google Sheets data. At the time of writing (11-16-2020), I have created most everything (outside of some trivial code copy and pasted in order to link Code_Canvas_Export.gs to the main app) on this branch: https://bitbucket.org/uclacdh/qb-2-question-bank-quick-builder/branch/ITGQB2-canvas-export-MASTER.

Canvas Export is not yet finished, due to an inability to acquire concise documentation Canvas' form of QTI XML.
